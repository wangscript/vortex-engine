Vortex is (supposed to be) a 3D game engine written entirely in C++.

The main goal with this project is not to create something that is state-of-the-art or superior to any other free open-source engine out there. The goal is just to create a fully functional game engine from the ground up, and learn alot from the process.

Vortex should be able to run on Windows and Linux, supporting DX10, DX11 and OpenGL.

For Windows, the source code includes Visual Studio 2010 project files.
For Linux, Vortex engine uses the GNU Autotools build system. Makefile is available in the root folder.

Development tools are being developed in parallel with the engine, http://code.google.com/p/maelstrom-editor/
